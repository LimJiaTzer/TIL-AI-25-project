## üõ†Ô∏è Projects & Solutions

Here's a breakdown of the challenges we tackled and the methodologies we employed to solve them.

---

### 1. üé§ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

**Challenge:** Accurately transcribe spoken audio into text.

**Our Approach:**  
We used a dual-model approach:
- **Primary Model:** [`nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2`](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2) ‚Äì a high-accuracy, efficient model for transcription tasks.
- **Secondary/Benchmark Model:** [`distil-whisper/distil-large-v3.5`](https://huggingface.co/distil-whisper/distil-large-v3.5) ‚Äì a lightweight, distilled version of Whisper offering robustness across diverse audio inputs.

### 2. üëÅÔ∏è Computer Vision (CV)

**Challenge:** Detect and identify specific objects within images with high speed and accuracy.

**Our Approach:**  
- **Model:** [`YOLOv8`](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8/) ‚Äì fine-tuned on a custom dataset.
- **Optimization:**  
  We converted the trained PyTorch model to a **TensorRT** `.engine` file to:
  - Reduce inference latency.
  - Accelerate evaluation on compatible GPU hardware.

### 3. üìÑ Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

**Challenge:** Extract text from scanned documents and images.

**Our Approach:**  
We deployed [`stepfun-ai/GOT-OCR-2.0-hf`](https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/GOT-OCR-2.0-hf), a transformer-based OCR model, which excels at:
- Recognizing complex text layouts.
- Extracting accurate text even under challenging visual conditions.

### 4. ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning: A Hybrid Agent System

**Challenge:** Develop an agent to navigate a complex environment guarded by intelligent opponents.

#### Part 1: Heuristic Guard Agent (Non-Learning)

- **Design:** A Finite State Machine (FSM) governs Guard behavior.
- **States:**
  - `PATROLLING` ‚Äî follows preset paths.
  - `HUNTING` ‚Äî chases visible Scouts.
  - `ROAMING` ‚Äî searches random areas.
- **Pathfinding:** Uses Dijkstra's algorithm on a precomputed map graph.

#### Part 2: Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Scout

- **Core Model:** Deep Q-Network (DQN) with a CNN visual input pipeline.
- **Hybrid Control Architecture:**
  - **Evasion Layer:** Rule-based override triggers when a Guard is nearby.
  - **Anti-Repetition Layer:** Heuristic avoids action loops by encouraging exploration.
  - **Default Mode:** DQN chooses the next action in safe conditions.

This hybrid design combines the pattern recognition of deep learning with the reliability of hand-coded heuristics, yielding a robust and adaptive agent.

### 5. üß© Surprise Challenge: Document Reassembly

**Challenge:** Reconstruct a shredded document from vertical strips.

**Our Approach:**  
- Treated as a **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**.
- **Cost Metric:** Dissimilarity score (e.g., Sum of Squared Differences) between strip edges.
- **Solution Strategy:**  
  - Constructed a cost matrix from edge comparisons.
  - Fed into a TSP solver (e.g., LKH or other libraries).
  - Output: Optimized strip order for accurate document reconstruction.
